# InfoSec Study

## [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique/ 'Wikipedia Pomorodo entry')sessions to help me study 25/5 for 1st 3 then 25/20 for 4th - repeat

- makes an 8a - 5p work day with 8 hrs wk & 1 hr of breaks

- Want to take test in 2 - 3 months
- CompTIA A+ test for entry level IT professionals

## Basic [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/ 'Anki Flash Card') Usage

- flash cards created on my laptop - can access on my iPhone
- uses [Active Recall Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall 'Wikipedia Active Recall Testing Entry')
- uses [Spaced Repetition](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/21xlmt/lpt_better_faster_and_easier_memorization_through/ 'Reddit Thread about Spaced Repetition')
- Downloaded Anki 2.1.19 alternate for Mac OS X 10.10+
- Easy download on macos Yosemite

### Cards - Question & Answer on each side like normal flash cards

- Card Types are templates

  - Templating - "handlebars" - {{ }} - syntax for variables

- Deck - a collection of cards
  - cards can be in multiple decks
  - decks can contain other decks
  - decks can contain all kinds of cards and notes
  - deck relationship syntax - trees - parent::subparent/superdeck::subdeck
  - decks should be BROAD categories!!!
    - too many decks slows down Anki - especially mobile
    - use tags or extra fields to group the smaller categories together
    - custom study & filtering features can create smaller temporary decks

* Note Types
  - Basic
  - Basic & Reversed
  - Basic & Optional Reversed
  - Cloze - ?????
* can change card types after creating them
* NOTE: we create notes, Anki creates the cards

* Collections

  - all the material stored in Anki
  - cards, notes, decks, note types, etc

* Shared Decks

  - Fastest way to get started
  - Can download shared decks through the desktop app
  - can not get shared decks thru the Anki account
  - Self-made decks are better for learning - supplementing

* Adding Cards

  - click ADD in the main window
  - which pops up an ADD window
  - pick TYPE
  - pick DECK
  - add FRONT & BACK
  - Anki checks for duplicate FRONT fields in a DECK
  - add optional tags if necessary - separated by space
  - click ADD to add card to DECK

* Adding Notes

  - Create new types of NOTES to include add'l info on CARDS
  - select TOOLS from pull-down
  - select MANAGE NOTE TYPES
  - click ADD to add a new type of note to your deck
  - pick what you want, add new fields if needed

* Deleting Notes
  - this is NOT intuitive
  - click BROWSE in the main window
  - in BROWSE window select the specific deck or card type
  - then select the NOTE you want to delete from the list
  - either select NOTES from pull-down or right-click on the NOTE
  - click DELETE
  - NOTE: if your note creates two card it will delete both of them

### TIPS from [SuperMemo] (https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules "SuperMemo 20 rules for formulating knowledge")

- Do Not Learn Without Understanding
- Do Not Memorize Without Learning
- Build Upon the Basics
- Stick to Minimum Information Principle
  - Keep the cards simple
  - Break complex up into multiple questions
- Cloze deletion easy & effective - fill in the blank questions
- Use imagery to stimulate different parts of your brain to aid memory
- use mnemonic techniques
- Graphic deletion as good as close deletion - fill in blank piece of a pic
- Avoid sets - like what countries are in Africa
  - use enumerations instead - like list countries in Africa alphabetically
  - still hard to remember
  - or convert the group into a more meaningful number of questions
- Avoid enumerations - use cloze deletions instead
- Combat interference - similar things confuse
  - make items unambiguous
  - keep it simple
  - remove interference when you spot it
- Optimize wording - remove unnecessary words
- Refer to other memories - can help simplify the questions
- Personalize and provide examples - act somewhat like mnemonics
- Rely on emotional states - personalize cards for you!
- Context cues will simplify wording - category & subcategory labelling
- Redundancy is good
- Include sources - but do not try to memorize them
- Provide date stamping
- Prioritize
  - always too much to learn 
  - make sure you pick the important parts

  ### [5 Cybersecurity Roles](https://infosecjon.com/the-5-cybersecurity-roles-you-need-to-know-about/ 'The 5 Cybersecurity Roles You Need To Know About')

  - growing field so lots of cross-over between job roles and titles
    - ex: security architects may work w/ programmers or design security systems
    - ex: security consultants may be hackers, sysadmins or sales engineers
    - pay attention to the job requirements
  - so roles and responsibilities may be confusing as well
  - most jobs will require performance across multiple roles

  #### 5 main roles: Hacker, Defender, Auditor, Engineer, Writer

  - Hacker - superstar

    - blurred face of cybersecurity
    - not publically known, but their roles are known
    - may be white, grey or black
    - roles: penetration testing and security research

  - Defender - lead role

    - often featured but usually misrepresented in the media
    - roles: analysis, forensics, incident response

  - Engineer - important background role

    - builders of security organizations
    - creators of software and physical infrastructure
    - mangages security policies for appliances to router access control lists
    - may design networks & control items like load balancers, DNS, switches
    - may design virtual or physical architectures
    - roles: network security engineer, security appliance engineer, software security engineer

  - Auditor - important background role

    - compliance specialists making sure orgs stick to rules
    - may be in-house, law office, regulatory body-government or industry

  - Writer - way in the background but creates the framework
    - create regulations and policies and rules
    - control definitions of privacy, customer rights, corporate responsibility

  #### Why look at the role types?

  - you can see where your prior IT experience fits
  - you can see where your task preference fits
  - to know what to study & practice to become a better candidate
  - once you know who you are, what you want to do
    - you will be better able to leverage your abilities
    - even without security experience
  - NOTE: in general HR is not exceptionally technical

    - jobs descriptions can be poorly written
    - ever-changing roles make it difficult
    - technical-oriented HR is growing

  - Apply to all jobs that look interesting
    - employers know they have to train folks up even up to the job requirements
    - often employers can just downgrade the position if they like you
    - posting requirements could be simply wrong
    - **you have a 0% chance of getting jobs you don't apply for**
    - **and a greater than 0% chance for most that you do**
