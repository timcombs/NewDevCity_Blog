# Page Widths
Say you’re looking to provide three different responsive page layouts: one for desktops, one for tablets (or laptops), and one for smartphones. Which page dimensions should you target as your cutoffs (e.g., 480px)?

Unfortunately, there’s no defined standard for the page widths to target, but the following example responsive values are often used:\
320px\
480px\
600px\
768px\
900px\
1024px\
1200px

However, a number of different width definitions exist. For example, 320 and Up has five default CSS3 Media Query increments: 480, 600, 768, 992, and 1382px. Along with the given example in this responsive web development tutorial, I could enumerate at least ten other approaches.

With any of these reasonable sets of increments, you can target most devices. In practice, there is usually no need to separately handle all of the aforementioned examples of page widths—seven different resolutions is probably overkill. In my experience, 320px, 768px, and 1200px are the most commonly used; these three values should be sufficient for targeting smart phones, tablets/laptops, and desktops, respectively.
