Schools and media often make it seem like the average coder works at a small startup when this is not necessarily the case. This series profiles coders who come from art and enterprise and startups and indie shops and teaching, asking them about their path into coding, why they love it, and how they continue to learn and grow in their profession.

This is a profile of Adilson Sandovar. He is from Mexico and I met him on Twitter when he was looking for a remote junior position. He had worked on a number of open source projects and was really helpful supporting me during my own job search.

**Is coding your primary career and what did you do before coding?**

I’ve dedicated myself completely as a developer for two-and-a-half years and I was a Mathematics teacher before that.

**How did you get into coding and how did you learn the skills to use code on a professional level?**

I learned programming in school when I was a teenager (C, Visual Basic) but the decision to make a career change came because I was looking for new challenges and the opportunity to work whenever and wherever I want.

About the skills to work as a Web Developer, I acquired them through online courses ([edX](https://www.edx.org "ed X website"), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org "Coursera website"), documentation ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org "MDN - Mozilla Developer Network"), [javascript.info](https://javascript.info "javascript.info website")), and platforms that could provide the tools to emulate working as a team ([Chingu](https://www.chingu.io "Chingu website")). I was also fortunate that I didn’t need to pay for any learning resource in order to become a professional developer, all thanks to the amazing people behind those platforms.


**Where do you live and what is the development scene like where you work?**

I’m from Mexico but, at the moment, I live in India. I work remotely, 8 hours daily and in a way that overlaps the time zones of my other teammates. 


**Do you work for an organization/company/yourself, what does the organization do?**

Yes, I work at [eyeo](https://eyeo.com "eyeo website"), where we build products that help develop and sustain a fair and open web: Adblock Plus, Adblock Browser, Flattr.


**What is your title and what do you do day-to-day as a coder?**

I’m considered a Developer and these are some of my duties:

- Implement new features
- Fix bugs
- Maintain healthiness in the codebase
- Give constructive feedback and participate in code reviews
- Keep up to date with current technologies

**How do you keep up with technology trends and what are you studying right now?**

Periodically reading articles and sharing knowledge with my teammates. At the moment I’m learning about testing (Mocha) and server routing with NodeJS.


**What do you like to do for fun?**

I love watching series and movies (sci-fi, mystery), and if it weren't for the current pandemic situation, I would also enjoy long walks.

**What tips would you like to give new coders?**

Focus on javascript basics, then look at the market and choose ONLY one technology to master.

Get experience either through Open Source contributions and/or try to emulate real work scenarios with other developers while following an [AGILE](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101 "website that describes the agile software process") process: Plan, Design, Develop, Test, Evaluate.


**Do you have favorite resources, creators or projects you would like to share?**

I think it all depends on the technology you are learning, but for javascript basics I would recommend MDN Docs and javascript.info.
