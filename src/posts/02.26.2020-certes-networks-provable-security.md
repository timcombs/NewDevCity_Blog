# Introducting Certes Networks Provable Security 

## Intro
- Speaker Sean Everson, CTO, Certes Networks
- How to make security quantifiable & measurable - thus a provable KPI
- Helps C-suite become fully vested in security
- CISOs expect network security teams enable with right tools
- Uses a piece of Certes hardware - low-latency & high-performing

## Pain Points
- How to put yourself in a position to prove that security works
- need tools that are compatible with networks
- need tools that work in real time
- need tools that make sure policies are being enforced

## 5 Pillars
- All interconnected

### Policy Enforcement
- Security is only as good as the policy that is enforced

### Crypto-Segmenttion
- Building strong policy as granular as you need them to be
- Create logical zones/area within network
- Able to protect data flows with military-grade encryption

### Scalability
- Implementation that is network agnostic
- Simple, scalable, end-to-end encryption management solution

### Visibility
- Encrypt data in transit and maintain network visibility
- No loss to performance

### Observability
- Visual proof that security strategy is working
- Policy enforcement engine with real time contextual metadata
- Data assurance

## Questions
- Why need additional encryption for SD-WAN - already built in?
  - There are still vulnerablities with SD-WAN
  - For a complex security environment - maybe you have multiple SD-WANs

- Always using a tool for flow data, what do I do?
  - Certes Provable Security is compatible with tools uses ipfix data
  - So can push Certes flow data to your tool

- Explain Cryptosegmentation better
  - define policy that describes a logical workflow or zone
  - then put strong cryptography on that zone
  - can separate your security posture from the overall topology

- Why doesn't this affect network performance?
  - it is designed from the ground-up to not add latency
  - designed to easily add it into the network without impacting the network
