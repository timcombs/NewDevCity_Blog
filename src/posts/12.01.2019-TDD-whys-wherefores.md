### What is TDD video

- TDD shares two elements of unit testing:
  - a test written in code
  - a piece of application logic to test
- Unit tests alone are not test driven development
- Unit Test - loosely

  - written code to test a unit of logic
  - example: to test one method on an object
  - example: to test one function
