# ISSA Webinar - International Series: 2019 - A Year in Review

## Panelists:

- Ira Winkler - Lead Security Principal - Trustwave - THIS GUY
- James McQuiggan - Security Awareness Advocate - KnowBe4
- Jim Reavis - CEO - Cloud Security Alliance

## Worst Breaches. Trends & Why?

- Seems that cybersecurity is underfunded
- often getting funding after major breaches
- Capital One breach
- Ransomware big deal - happens cuz phishing attacks
  - get C-Suite to care and do the training
  - hard/software firewalls vulnerable thus "Human" Firewalls can't be trusted
  - can reduce risk - but not eliminate it
- Security awareness is about risk reduction
- Need a total security infrastructure

  - can not just focus on the proximity of the initiation (click phishing email)
  - don't put the user on the front line
  - expect the user to fail
    - don't let them click it in the first place
    - set network permissions and update systems to mitigate this
    - have systems that hunt for "breach" and mitigate it

  ## Where did Infosec Win the Day?

  - governance - communication from CSO to Board is better than ever before
  - technology - automation is making response time faster
  - AI & Deep Learning - will bring new challenges
  - acknowledgement that infosec important is increasing
    - nation state actors making it a priority
    - cyberhygiene is still a concern but a seen concern now
    - automation is improving
  - banning paying ransomware attackers
    - ransomware hacks are evolving
    - originally just holding your data until org pays
    - now damaging your backups before holding data
    - now damaging backups and threatening to leak data unless org pays

## How to put the most resilient security infrastructure in place

- cyberhygiene is GREAT risk reduction - no where near 100% coverage
- DOD 77% of attacks could have been turned back if cyberhygiene in place
- hackers will evolve, but cyberhygiene coverage is really low
- automated cyberhygiene reduces risk by allowing the security team to focus on fewer incidents
- AI/machine learnig automation will help this as well
- but AI is a threat as well - DEEP FAKES
- will always be a game of cat-and-mouse

## What happens in 2020?

- more cloud breaches because the sheer amount of data in the cloud
  - unprotected storage buckets
  - improper credentials
  - is their system configured or just turned-on
  - patches not updated
  - orphan systems
- 2020 presidential election hijinks
  - elevated passions for hackers
  - both on the left and the right and the amoral
- SAAS companies need to know that they own MOST of the security responsibility
- more attacks than last year - cyberterrorism, ransomware, evolution of attacks

## 2020 Desires

- want organizations to look at cybersecurity like they do accounting
- want organizations to start to use the systems and best practices
- solid multi-factor authentication EVERYWHERE
- find the low-hanging fruit to mitigate over half of the incidents

## My Question about how to get into infosec from webdev

- don't look at legacy stuff so much
- don't worry so much about old certifications
- get into DevSecOps
- ctsk???
