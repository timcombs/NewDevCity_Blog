# InfoSec Study

## macos Terminal

- unix based with a darwin kernel
- can enter commands directly into the unix environment
- linux and unix are very close - but not all linux commands work on macos
- can do bulk operations
- can do fast calculations

- macos Terminal needs to run a Shell
- Shell is a program that allows the user to interface with the operating system at a terminal

  - Bash is default macos shell and very popular
  - lots of other shells: Fish, Z Shell, etc.

- as always to get more info about any command use

  ```bash
  man [command] OR info [command] OR help [command]
  ```

### Basics

- mkdir - make directories
- cd - navigate to a new directory
- touch - creates a file
- ls - lists files in a directory
- . represents the current level
- .. represents a level above
- rm - deletes files & directories - no recovery
- pwd - print working directory to screen - current directory location

### Next Level

- top
  - gives a list of every program running on your computer
  - each entry shows how much of the system resources it uses
    - PID is the programs Process ID
    - %CPU is how much CPU resource program is using
    - %MEM is how much memory resource program is using
  - ctrl-C to return to command line prompt
- kill - use to end programs - need PID number
- ifconfig - utility gets info or change network interface configuration
  - similar to ipconfig on windows machines
  - must be at root directory or use sudo to use this
  - gives information about devices on your network:
  - IP address of computer
  - MAC address of Ethernet & WiFi cards
  - and lots more
- chmod & chown
  - chmod allows file permission changes
  - chown allows file ownership changes
- ssh - allows you to get remote access to another computer

### Cool Tricks for terminal

- Copy files and directories from one directory to another

  - can do this using 'cp' command:
    ```bash
    cp some_directory/some-file.txt another_directory
    ```
  - can do this using 'ditto' command:
    ```bash
    ditto some_directory/some-file.txt another_directory
    ```
  - the difference is ditto copies exactly
    - like cp preserves ownership attributes and permissisons
    - but also preserves file resource forks and folder metadata

- List the all the contents of a directory

  - this shows the files and names of sub-directories
    ```bash
    ls [path-of-directory]
    ```
  - adding the -R flag shows all the files & directories in sub-directories
    ```bash
    ls -R [path-of-directory]
    ```
    doing this in your root directory is not a smart thing

- View the contents of any file

  - will even open corrupt files, though it might help you discern anything
    ```bash
    cat [file-path]
    ```

- Download files from the command line

  - don't need a browser - use the curl command
    ```bash
    curl -O [url://of-the.file]
    ```
  - will put this in the pwd (current directory)

- Keep your mac from sleeping

  - overrides sleep settings in Energy preferences
    ```bash
    caffeinate
    ```

* type ctrl-c to end the command
* or to set a time limit:

  ```bash
  caffeinate -u -t [#-of-seconds]
  ```

* Change file and directory permissions

  - a couple of ways to do this - chmod and chown
  - to change permissions so anyone can access, read & modify
    ```bash
    sudo chmod 777 [path-to-file]
    ```
  - to change so only access and readability only
    ```bash
    sudo chmod 644 [path-to-file]
    ```
  - to change ownership of a file to your account
    ```bash
    sudo chown [your-short-user-name] [path-to-file]
    ```

* Automatically restart after a crash

  - not sure if this is a good thing, but...
    ```bash
    sudo systemsetup -setstartfreeze on
    ```

* Restore disk image to a volume

  - disk image is a .dmg file basically a cloning operation
  - can create additional bootable startup drives this way
    ```bash
    sudo asr -restore -noverify -source /[path-to-diskimage] -target /[volume to restore to]
    ```

* Hide files or folders from view in the finder

  ```bash
  chflags hidden [path/of/folder/to/hide]
  ```

* create ASCII art banners

  ```bash
  banner -w [banner-width-in-pixels] [your-message]
  ```

* make your mac talk
  ```bash
  say "[what-you-want-to-say]"
  ```

#### Change user defaults at the command line

- the defaults command allows access to the user's defaults
- the write command is used to write new default values
  ```bash
  man defaults
  ```
  for more information
  ```bash
  defaults read
  ```
  will display a massive list of key-value pairs
  ```bash
  killall
  ```
  is used to stop the process
  ```bash
  killall Finder
  ```
- the read command allows you see what the current values are

- Show hidden files and folders

  - these are files that are prefixed with a "." like .DS_Store
    ```bash
     defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool TRUE
    ```
    then
    ```bash
    killall Finder
    ```
    change "TRUE" to "FALSE" to rehide the hidden files

- Disable drop shadows on screenshots of a desktop window

  - quite specific
  - type command-shift-4 & hit the space bar when cursor is over the window
  - the screenshot will have a drop shadow
  - to remove it
    ```bash
    defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool TRUE
    ```
    then
    ```bash
    killall SystemUIServer
    ```
    change "TRUE" to "FALSE" to put the drop shadow back

- Hide non-active apps in your Dock

  ```bash
  defaults write com.apple.dock static-only -bool TRUE
  ```

  then

  ```bash
  killall Dock
  ```

  change "TRUE" to "FALSE" to show all apps that you've kept in the dock

- Dim hidden apps in the Dock

  - supposed to dim apps that aren't visible on-screen
  - can't really tell any difference
  - strangely running this opens all windows that are hidden in the dock
    ```bash
    defaults write com.apple.Dock showhidden -bool TRUE
    ```
    then
    ```bash
    killall Dock
    ```
    change "TRUE" to "FALSE" to remove the dimming

- Make holding down a key repeat that character

  - hold a key and type many of that same character
    ```bash
    defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool FALSE
    ```
    change "TRUE" to "FALSE" to stop this behavior

- Make mac chime like an iPhone when connected to power

  ```bash
  defaults write com.apple.PowerChime ChimeOnAllHardware -bool TRUE
  ```

  then

  ```bash
  open /System/Library/CoreServices/PowerChime.app
  ```

  to stop the chiming

  ```bash
  defaults write com.apple.PowerChime ChimeOnAllHardware -bool FALSE
  ```

  then

  ```bash
  killall PowerChime
  ```

- Change the default screenshot save location

  ```bash
  defaults write com.apple.screencapture location [place-to-save-screenshots]
  ```

- Change the default screenshot type and name

  - screenshots can be JPG, PNG, TIFF, PDF
    ```bash
    defaults write com.apple.screencapture type [type-of-file]
    ```
  - any name you want followed by date and time
    ```bash
    defaults write com.apple.screencapture name "[name-you-want]"
    ```
    then
    ```bash
    killall SystemUIServer
    ```

- Stop apps from saving to iCloud by default

  - not sure what version of macos this is default, not in Yosemite
    ```bash
    defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSDocumentSaveNewDocumentsToCloud -bool FALSE
    ```
    change "FALSE" to "TRUE" to default save to iCloud again

- Set frequency to check for macos updates

  - this sets it to once a day
    ```bash
    sudo defaults /Library/Preferences/write com.apple.SoftwareUpdate ScheduleFrequency -int 1
    ```
    to reset to what it was before
    ```bash
    sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate ScheduleFrequency
    ```
    which deletes this key-value pair

- Enable text selection in Quick Look

  - to use Quick Look select a file and hit the spacebar
  - to make it so you can copy text from quick look
    ```bash
    defaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool TRUE
    ```
    then
    ```bash
    killall Finder
    ```
    change "TRUE" to "FALSE" to stop this behavior

- Change the response speed of the Dock

  - change delay time

    ```bash
    defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float O
    ```

    then

    ```bash
    killall Dock
    ```

    to revert back to default

    ```bash
    defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay
    ```

    then

    ```bash
    killall Dock
    ```

  - change speed it slides into view
    ```bash
    defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0
    ```
    then
    ```bash
    killall Dock
    ```
    1 is default speed, 0.5 will double the speed, 0 is instant

- Add message to login window
  ```bash
  sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginWindowText "Welcome to the Knowledge Box"
  ```
  to remove it
  ```bash
  sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow
  ```
