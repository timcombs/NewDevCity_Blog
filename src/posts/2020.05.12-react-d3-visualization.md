## Data Scientist vs Interactive Designer
The concerns of these two are different

### Data Scientist
math, algorithms, analysis, data integrity

**vs**

### Interactive Designer
UX, graphics & screen space, visualization concepts, aesthetics

**Overall Keep It Simple**

## Reasons to not use D3?

- D3 not the only visualization library
- library is huge and more than you need
- exterior circumstances make it best to add to your team's stack
- D3 has a steep learning curve
- do you have enough time to fall down the rabbit hole?

## Why D3 with React?

- lots of capabilities
- calculates data & translates visually really well
- huge support community
- lots of open source examples to reference
- great to take raw data to a visualization
- abstracts away the repetitive tasks
- uses SVG so it is scalable
- can also use HTML5 Canvas, but not good for animations

## Who controls the DOM?

### D3 
- Transitions
- Axes
- Brushes

### React
- Page Layout
- UI Element & Interactions
