# Learning how to Learn

What is Learning:
I'm taking the Coursera Learning How to Learn course
https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn

While I've always been a "book-smart" student, the course is teaching me more than I thought about how learning happens. The course lessons are backed up by neurological science. Learning is not something only for the young, there are techniques that are easily obtainable to help you learn difficult subjects in any discipline.

"We ordinarily think of learning as something we do when we sit down to study a book. But actually, being able to learn more easily and deeply involves many important facets--including not only periods of focused concentration, but also periods of relaxation, and even times when the body is simply out getting exercise. Your brain can be busy figuring things out during times when you have absolutely no conscious awareness of it."

Methods to use when learning something new
- analogy
- metaphor
- focused mode & diffuse modes of learning are both important
- mnemonics
- visual imagery
- avoiding procrastination
- scheduling in breaks, rewards, exercise, and stopping times

Focused mode learning
- direct approach to problem-solving
- rational, sequential, analytical
- uses the prefrontal cortex of the brain

Diffuse mode learning
- indirect approach to problem-solving
- take a shower, take a break, daydream
- exercise, sleep
- research shows that exercise is just as important as an enriched environment for allowing the brain to grow new neurons

Why does procrastination happen?
- procrastination is very common
- even good l
- learning is hard, thus, emotionally painful
- our brains try to switch our mental attention away from pain
- this is similar to the addiction cycle

Why is procrastination bad?
- creates stress because there isn't enough time to complete what is needed
- stress slows the learning process
- cramming information in few, as opposed to many, study sessions means less information goes into long-term memory

How does your memory work?
- short-term memory is like a small white board that only holds a few things at one time
- repetition "cements" those topics we learn into the long-term memory like a brick warehouse
- cramming, or little repetition, makes the brick warehouse fragile
- this cementing of short-term memory topics into long-term memory storage happens by forming and strengthening the synaptic connection through repetition and reinforcement
- using multiple formats, techniques and media to study the same topic helps to strenghten the synaptic pathways
- brain connectivity is dynamic, ever-changing

Practice, Practice, Practice
- practice is important to develop expertise
- practice should happen in differing settings at differing times
- the more abstract the concept, the more important practice is to make it real

Methods to stop procrastinating:
- Pomodoro Technique
- understanding one's procrastination cues
- learning to push past the desire to stop before you start working on a topic
- learning to push past the desire to stop when working on hard-to-learn parts
- studying in a quiet place with no distractions
- coming up with a study routine - times of days, techniques

What is the Pomodoro Technique?
- repeated cycles of focused learning then a small break/reward after the focus
- most often as 25 min focus/5 min break, on the 4th cycle the break is 20-30 min
- works best if you remove all distractions during the focus
- works best if the breaks are diffuse, unfocused time

Why does the Pomodoro Technique work?
- it helps a learner avoid procrastination
- it gives the brain the breaks it needs to let to make random connections in a relaxed fashion
- it refreshes the brain between focus sessions

Next level learning techniques
- interleaving different topics
- getting plenty of sleep
  - not getting enough sleep is bad for the body and bad for the mind
  - the mind needs sleep to clear out toxins and reinforce important topics
  - studying important material just before bed allows the brain to dream about the topics in diffuse mode 
- making lists of tomorrow's work just before you go to sleep
